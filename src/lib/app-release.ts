// Every release is mandatory. The shop's tablets are updated by someone
// walking over to them, so an old build will otherwise sit there selling
// for months against a server that has moved on — which is how a cart gets
// priced by rules the bill no longer agrees with. Rather than deciding
// case by case whether a given change is "important enough" to force,
// minBuildNumber is pinned to the published build: install the new APK, or
// the app stops at the update screen.
//
// So a release is exactly two edits, and they must agree:
//   1. pubspec.yaml   version: x.y.z+BUILD
//   2. BUILD below, plus VERSION and the note
// Then rebuild the APK and copy it to public/downloads/odg-sale.apk.
